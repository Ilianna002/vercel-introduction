        <h1>Hello Vercel Team!</h1>
        <p>Hey there! I’m Ilianna Prepis, and I’m thrilled to meet you! With a solid 5-year adventure in Customer Success under my belt, I’m all about building lasting relationships with customers and turning challenges into victories. I love diving deep into problem-solving and championing both the product and the company I’m part of.

What excites me about Customer Success is the chance to be a trusted partner in our customers' journeys, helping them unlock their full potential and achieve their goals. Joining Vercel feels like the perfect next step because of your commitment to innovation and excellence. I’m eager to bring my passion and experience to your team, ensuring that every customer experience with Vercel is as dynamic and impactful as the solutions you offer. Let’s make great things happen together!.</p>
        
        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>Here is a brief overview of my professional journey:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>[Senior Customer Manager] at [Stack Overflow] - [April 2023 - Present]</li>
            <li>[Senior Implementation Manager] at [Stack Overflow] - [March 2021 - April 2023]</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>When I’m not diving into the world of Customer Success, you’ll find me embracing my inner DIY enthusiast—whether it’s painting a room, fixing up furniture, or tackling a new project. I’m also a big fan of staying active, so you might catch me running through trails, biking around town, or hiking up scenic paths. In the kitchen, I love experimenting with new recipes and cooking up delicious creations. And when it’s time to unwind, there’s nothing better than curling up with a great book or spinning some vinyl records from my ever-growing collection. From crafting to cooking, and everything in between, I’m all about enjoying life’s adventures and discovering new passions!</p>
